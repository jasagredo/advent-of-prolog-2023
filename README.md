# Solutions to Advent of code 2023 with Scryer-Prolog

I chose [Scryer Prolog](https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog)
because I think is the more reasonable Prolog out there (not that I
investigated much, but swi always felt too deviant from the ISO
Prolog).

I'm not an expert on Prolog, but I like how clean it looks once a
puzzle is solved.

This being said, I try to be as idiomatic as possible, using DCGs
where possible and avoiding "imperative style" prolog.

Any improvements or corrections you see on the code, please send them
my way as only by correcting our previous knowledge we learn new
stuff.
